The Ninja Story engine gets its name from the game it was originally designed for - Ninja Story. The original developer has halted work on the engine, but there are hopes it will still be useful to someone.

The engine is for creating a side-scroller multiplayer RPG. The original design was intended to create something similar to Maple Story.
